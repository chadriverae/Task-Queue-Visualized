<h1>Project Description<h1/>
In this project, I developed a circular doubly linked data structure to efficiently manage and cycle through a task queue, ensuring 
seamless task progression. To enhance understanding and presentation, I visualized the data structure using a pie chart generated 
with the matplotlib module, providing clear insights into the task distribution and flow within the system.
