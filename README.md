# Project Description
In this project, I developed a Bidirectional linked list to manage and cycle through a task queue efficiently, ensuring 
seamless task progression. To enhance understanding and presentation, I visualized the data structure using a pie chart generated 
with the Matplotlib module, providing clear insights into the task distribution and flow within the system.
